"Welcome to the repository of my portfolio website, alexpawlonski.tech.

The code of the website is public, and I invite you to take a look if you ever wish to work with me, so you can see how I work.

## Furthermore, it operates on Next.js, and can be launched in several ways:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
